/**
 * High level object to collect historical and realtime data about a specific contract.
 * This is the preferred object to deal with stock time series into the framework.
 * It contains three different time series:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A OHLC time series, that can be updated with realtime and historical bars</li>
 * <li>A tick time series, that can be fed with historical and realtime ticks</li>
 * <li>A consolidated OHLC time series, that presents a unified view of the OHLC and tick
 * time series, reacting to each update in real time</li>
 * </ul>
 * Callers typically use the consolidated "virtual" OHLC series, since it conveys the
 * information in a convenient OHLC format, but it reacts to new data, allowing tick-based
 * algorithms.
