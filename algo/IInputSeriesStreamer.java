/**
 * Simulator of realtime series.
 * Implementors simulate a realtime series by reading historical data and filling a slave
 * series, initially empty.
 * The iteration must be carried out synchronously from a single thread, to give the client
 * a way to react synchronously during a simulation.
 * At each iteration, clients can read the timestamp of the last item added to the series:
 * this timestamp can be used as an approximated current time within the simulation.
